# Do we use IPv4, 6 or both
# inet for IPv4, inet6 for IPv6, any for IPv4 & 6
AddressFamily inet

# What local IP address(es) should sshd listen on
ListenAddress $IPv4

# Logging
LogLevel VERBOSE

# Disable Forwarding
# N.B Users can install their own forwarders
X11Forwarding no
AllowTcpForwarding no

# use builtin OpenSSH SFTP Server
Subsystem sftp /usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server

# Authentication
# public key auth only, only users in sudo group can login
# Only allows use of ed25519 and RSA keys

# Path to private  keys
# Better dir structure /etc/ssh/keys/ssh_host_$_key
HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key

# File the public keys that can be used for user authentication live in
# each user has their own authorized_keys file in their home fodler
AuthorizedKeysFile %h/.ssh/authorized_keys

# Allows use of only ed25519 and RSA keys
